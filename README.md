Step 1: Data Extraction

Retrieve historical stock data effortlessly using the yfinance library from Yahoo Finance. Access data dating back to January 2010 for in-depth trend analysis.

Step 2: Data Preparation

The collected data is converted into a pandas DataFrame, date columns are formatted, and data is scaled for consistency. Splitting into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets ensures robust model evaluation. Data is transformed into sequences to uncover intricate patterns.

Step 3: Building the Model

Craft a powerful deep learning model using the LSTM architecture, known for capturing temporal dependencies. This model features two LSTM layers with 50 units, followed by a dense layer with 25 units and a final dense layer for predicting future stock prices. Training spans 100 epochs.

Step 4: Visualization and Analysis

Visualize the model's predictions alongside actual stock prices using matplotlib. Explore trends, oscillations, and potential turning points for deeper insights into the market.

Step 5: Model Accuracy

Evaluate the model's accuracy by calculating the mean squared error (MSE) and presenting it as a percentage. This metric provides a clear measure of the model's performance, boosting confidence in navigating the stock market's complexities.
